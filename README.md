# The technology of Virtual Machine Monitors and Architectural support for VM Operating Systems

This project deal with the architectural support for  **virtualization** running over a **host OS**. Virtualization today is mainly ahndled by hypervisor technology. Here we look at how the architecture of a system can support the *security of a virtual machine*, *memmory isloation* for the VM and *hybrid virtualization* of the VMs.
