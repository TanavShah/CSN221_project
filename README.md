# The technology of Virtual Machine Monitors and Architectural support for VM Operating Systems

### Abstract

A virtual-machine monitor (VMM), also known as hypervisor enables creation. management and governance of Virtual Machines on top of a physical host machine. VMM manages the backend operation of VMs by allocating the nescessary computing, memory, storage and other I/O resorces. A few simple extensions to a host operating system can make it a mush faster platform for running a VMM.
