The VMM process in UMLinux uses `ptrace` to intercept key events (system calls and signals) executed by the guest-machine process. `ptrace` is a powerful tool for debugging, but using it to create a virtual machine causes the host OS to context switch frequently between the guest-machine process and the VMM process.
